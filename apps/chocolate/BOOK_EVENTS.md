# Creepy Chocolate Collector - Book Events Documentation

This document describes all events emitted by the Creepy Chocolate Collector game for frontend integration.

## Event Structure

All events are stored in the `events` array within each book. Each event has a `type` field and additional properties specific to that event type.

## Base Game Events

### `reveal`
Board reveal for each spin.
```json
{
  "type": "reveal",
  "board": [
    [
      {"name": "L2"},
      {"name": "H1"},
      {"name": "JAR", "scatter": true}
    ]
  ],
  "paddingPositions": [70, 162, 212],
  "gameType": "basegame",
  "anticipation": [0, 0, 1, 2]
}
```

### `setTotalWin`
Sets the total win amount for the spin.
```json
{
  "type": "setTotalWin",
  "amount": 500
}
```

### `spinWinTotal` ⭐ **NEW COMPLETE WIN EVENT**
Provides complete spin total breakdown for win animations.
```json
{
  "type": "spinWinTotal",
  "amount": 227,
  "lineWins": 200,
  "collections": 27
}
```

**Fields:**
- `amount`: Total win for the spin (line wins + collections)
- `lineWins`: Win amount from line wins only

**Usage:**
- Emitted after all collections are processed for the spin
- Frontend can use `amount` directly for win animations
- Eliminates need for complex calculations and timing issues
- Always provides accurate, complete spin totals

## Big-Bass Mechanics Overview

### Level System
- **4 Levels**: Level 1 (x1), Level 2 (x2), Level 3 (x3), Level 4 (x10)
- **Segment-based**: Levels are locked for variable-length segments
- **First Segment**: Length matches initial bonus (10/15/20 spins based on scatter count)
- **Subsequent Segments**: Always 10 spins each
- **Progression**: Every 4 Collector Wilds queue a level-up and retrigger
- **Advancement**: Level-ups and retriggers occur at segment boundaries
- **Maximum Retrigs**: 3 total (one each for levels 2, 3, and 4)

### Collection Formula
```
collected_amount = cc_sum × cw_count × level_multiplier
```

### Event Flow Example (15-spin initial bonus)
1. Player gets 4 scatters → 15 initial spins
2. Player hits 4 CWs on spin 2 → Level-up and retrigger queued
3. Spins 3-15 continue at Level 1 (segment-locked)
4. Spin 16 → `level_advance` event with `extra_spins_granted: 10` → Level 2 begins with 10 extra spins
5. CW+CC combination on spin 16 → `collection` event at Level 2 (x2 multiplier)

## Frontend Integration Notes

### For Collection Animation
- Use `cw_count` and `cc_count` to display and animate collecting symbols
- Use `subcollections` array to show individual CW payouts
- Display `level` to show current multiplier
- Use `collected_amount` for final payout display

### For Level Progression UI
- Track `level_advance` events to trigger level-up animations
- Use `extra_spins_granted` field to display retrigger notifications
- Show progression toward next level based on CW accumulation  
- Display current segment's locked multiplier
- Show remaining spins counter (including retriggered spins)

### For Statistics/RTP
- Sum all `collected_amount` values for total collection contribution
- Track level distribution from `level_advance` events
- Monitor collection frequency and values by level

## Symbol Definitions

- **CW (Collector Wild)**: Special wild symbol that collects chocolate cash (freegame mode only)
- **CC (Chocolate Cash)**: Cash symbols with `cash_value` attribute (2-2000x bet)
- **JAR**: Scatter symbol that triggers free spins (3+ required)
- **H1-H4**: High-value regular symbols
- **L1-L5**: Low-value regular symbols
